## Known Tech Debt

| Item | Impact | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| ~48 modules flat import | Low | app.module.ts imports all modules without domain grouping |
| E2E test coverage (12 files) | Medium | Covers critical paths, missing edge cases |
| Docker image size ~2GB | Low | postgres:16-alpine base is large |

## Remaining

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| Deploy staging server (VPS) | **High** | Needs VPS + GitHub secrets (STAGING_HOST, SSH_KEY) |
| Mobile PWA / manifest | Medium | manifest.json + service worker for offline |
| Monitoring (ELK/Grafana) | Medium | Status API exists, full stack missing |
| Multi-language i18n | Medium | Only vi/en basics, 50% pages translated |
| Domain refactoring | Medium | 48→6 domain modules |
| API versioning | Low | Needs design + frontend coordination |

## Team Role Assessment Addendum (2026-06-29)

A role-based review has been added in `docs/team-role-gap-assessment.md` to translate the roadmap into a real dev-team operating model. The highest-priority gaps are product/test traceability, API governance, observability, security program automation, PWA/offline hardening, release rollback playbooks, and data governance for forecast/analytics.

| Role area | New gap | Priority | Tracking |
|-----------|---------|----------|----------|
| Product + QA | PRD/persona/acceptance criteria must trace to automated tests | High | GAP-ROLE-01 |
| Architecture + Backend | ADRs, API versioning, error catalog, and contract tests | High | GAP-ROLE-02/03 |
| SRE + DevOps | Observability stack, SLOs, alerting, staging, rollback drill | High | GAP-ROLE-04/08 |
| Security | Threat model, ASVS checklist, secret/dependency/container scanning | High | GAP-ROLE-05 |
| Frontend/PWA | Production PWA manifest, service worker, offline UX test matrix | High | GAP-ROLE-06 |
| Data/AI | Data contracts, PII classification, forecast accuracy monitoring | Medium | GAP-ROLE-09 |
| Support/Docs | Incident runbook, support triage SOP, troubleshooting matrix | Medium | GAP-ROLE-10 |

## Closed (Won't Fix)

| Gap | Notes |
|-----|-------|
| CSRF protection | JWT Bearer tokens (stateless) — CSRF only applies to cookie auth |
| Build time optimization | Docker layer cache + CI cache + parallel workers applied |
