## Known Tech Debt

| Item | Impact | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| ~48 modules flat import | Low | app.module.ts imports all modules without domain grouping |
| Legacy .coverage.spec.ts convention | None | 166 co-located test files — all have real test logic (0 empty stubs) |

## Remaining

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| Gop packages nho | Medium | Deferred |
| Single point of failure | Medium | Tach container khi scale |
| 48 modules nesting | Medium | Domain refactor |
| API versioning | Medium | Needs design, requires frontend coordination |
| Monitoring/logging | Medium | ELK stack setup |

## Closed (Completed)

| Gap | Sprint | Resolution |
|-----|--------|------------|
| Barcode scanner POS | S26 | GET /products/by-barcode/:code + frontend scan UI + JsBarcode |
| Print templates | S24 | PrintService: GET /print/invoice/:id + /print/purchase-order/:id |
| PDF/XLSX export | S25 | ExportPdfService: pdfkit-based PDF generation |
| Multi-currency | S31 | GET/PATCH /settings/currency + PriceDisplay component |
| System status API | S32 | GET /status: version, uptime, dbStatus |
| Load test infra | S33 | scripts/load-test.mjs: 10 concurrent users |
| Release notes gen | S33 | fetch-depth: 0 + generate-release-notes.js |

## Closed (Won't Fix)

| Gap | Notes |
|-----|-------|
| CSRF protection | JWT Bearer tokens (stateless) — CSRF only applies to cookie auth |
| Build time optimization | Docker layer cache + CI cache + parallel workers applied |
